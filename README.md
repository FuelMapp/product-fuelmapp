# FuelMapp

### See the real-time price of fuel for every petrol station in Spanish territory

## Intro

Finding the best place to refuel your vehicle can be a tricky situation.
Sometimes a small variation in price can lead to a massive expense, and while
nobody likes overspending, most people tend to refuel at the most convenient
spot instead of the most efficient

FuelMapp is a map based web application where users can easily find the petrol
station that suits their needs. Station data is obtained from a public API
provided by the Spanish government. Data is updated every 30 minutes and prices
are gathered through a mandatory state-wide report, so users will be always
receiving the official up-to-date information
